# RaptorJIT

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/raptorjit/raptorjit.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/raptorjit/raptorjit)

RaptorJIT is an experimental fork of LuaJIT. Premise: What would I do
if I were only trying to please myself and nobody else?

Welcome to propose radical changes! (Shock me! :-))

Check out the
[RaptorJIT performance regression tests](https://hydra.snabb.co/job/luajit/branchmarks/benchmarkResults/latest/download/2) 
that automatically check for performance differences with other LuaJIT
forks/branches/versions.
